Binary trees Project files

Project goals knowledge about:
What is a binary tree.
What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree.
What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists.
What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree.
What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree.
What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree.
